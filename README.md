# BlogQL (naming convention bland until proper title is given)

- A foray into creating a website using **`React.js`**, **`MongoDB`**, **`Express`**, **`GraphQL`**, **`Node`**, etc.

## Current Issues / Features 

- [x] create login for admin role
- [ ] logout button 
- [ ] when admin creates post it generates to the Posts page
- [ ] idea generator 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
- *npm run dev* for `server` generation
- *npm start* for `client` generation

## What I've learned

- security is a feature not a bug

## Future of the Blog 

- I am currently toying with **`GraphQL`** and **`JWT`** for authenticating an admin role to create and delete posts. 
- Would like for **upvoting** and **downvoting** features, also likes and hearts, etc. The usual suspects in *modern* approval ratings.
- This will be a fully functional blog I will use for **professional** measures.
