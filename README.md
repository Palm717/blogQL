# BlogQL (naming convention bland until proper title is given)

- A foray into creating a website using **`React.js`**, **`MongoDB`**, **`Express`**, **`GraphQL`**, **`Node`**, etc.

## Current Issues / Features 

**MAJOR ISSUE** 
 - ~~TOKEN not created or storing as cookie to frontend. Successfull on the backend~~

---

- [x] create login for admin role
- [x] logout button 
- [ ] move posting features (add, delete, edit ) to /profile page
- [ ] when admin creates, deletes, edits post -- render to the /posts page
- [ ] create some sort of landing page ( I think ) 
- [ ] idea generator 


### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
- *npm run dev* for `server` generation
- *npm start* for `client` generation

### What I've learned

- security is a feature not a bug

### Future of the Blog 

- I am currently toying with **`GraphQL`** and **`JWT`** for authenticating an admin role to create and delete posts. 
- Would like for **upvoting** and **downvoting** features, also likes and hearts, etc. The usual suspects in *modern* approval ratings.
- This will be a fully functional blog I will use for **professional** measures.
